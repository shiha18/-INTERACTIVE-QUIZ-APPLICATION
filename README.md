As part of my front-end internship at CodTech, I was given the opportunity to build a Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This task marked the beginning of my journey into real-world web development, and I chose to complete it using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which made the entire learning process much smoother and enjoyable.
The main goal of this task was to create a simple quiz where users could answer multiple-choice questions and receive immediate feedback. At first, it seemed like a small project, but as I began writing the code, I realized how many important web development concepts were involved. I started by designing the basic structure using HTML—creating sections for questions, answer options, and the score display. This helped me understand how important HTML is as the backbone of any web page.
Next, I worked on styling the app using CSS. This part was fun and creative, as I learned how to add colors, spacing, and layout features to make the app look clean and responsive. It gave me a better understanding of how CSS enhances the user experience and makes an interface visually appealing.
The most challenging and rewarding part was writing the logic in JavaScript. I used JavaScript to handle everything dynamically—loading questions, handling user selections, giving instant feedback, and displaying the final score. This helped me learn how to work with functions, arrays, loops, and event listeners in a practical way. For the first time, I saw how JavaScript brings a static page to life by making it interactive and dynamic.
I used VS Code throughout the project, which made development easier with features like syntax highlighting, live server preview, extensions for HTML/CSS/JS, and auto-completion. It really helped me understand how professional developers organize and build their projects.
Through this task, I not only improved my technical skills but also developed a better problem-solving mindset. I learned how to break down a project into smaller tasks, debug errors, and structure code in a clean and readable way. I also explored useful online resources like YouTube and ChatGPT to clarify doubts and learn new methods.
This project boosted my confidence in using the core web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—and showed me that I can build useful and interactive applications on my own. I also realized the importance of version control and plan to push this project to GitHub to showcase it in my portfolio.
